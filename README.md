# Part 9. TypeScript

This part is all about TypeScript: and open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript.

In this part we will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing TypeScript.

## a. Background and introduction

## b. First steps with TypeScript
